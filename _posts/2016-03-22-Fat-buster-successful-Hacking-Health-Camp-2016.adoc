:hp-tags: fw4spl, hhcamp, orthanc

We were present at http://hhcamp.sparkboard.com/[Hacking health camp 2016] in Strasbourg between the 17th and 20th March !

Fw4spl has been used successfully on the project http://hhcamp.sparkboard.com/project/56c20d517a933c0300d8df46[Fat Buster], to compute the amount of fat inside the peritoneum from a CT-Scan.It was a pleasure to work with the developers from http://www.osimis.io/[Osimis] who were in charge of the website frontend and backend, using http://orthanc-server.com/[Orthanc].
 
The project has received two prices : *Best solution targeting clinics* and *Rockstart price*.

The code developed during the week-end is open-source and available on https://bitbucket.org/fatbuster/[Bitbucket].
