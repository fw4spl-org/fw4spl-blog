= Development status - v0.10.2


Hi folks,

Here is a small update for people interested in trying the latest version of fw4spl.

The current stable version is 0.10.1. We are currently working on the version 0.10.2. While 0.10.1 didn't bring deep changes, the version 0.10.2 is much more ambitious. 

For instance we removed the old messaging system. Thus, the `IService::receive()` method no longer exists and *objects messages* were all deleted. Communication is now only done via *signals/slots*, which is much clearer and simpler. 

Moreover, creating and editing the *profile.xml* was quite redundant with maintaining the dependencies in *Properties.cmake*. Thus this file is now automatically generated through CMake. Also you no longer have to start bundles manually, this is specified in the *Properties.cmake* file of the bundle.

The documentation for this new branch has been generated on http://fw4spl-doc.readthedocs.org/en/fw4spl_0.10.2/[ReadTheDocs].

However to try out this branch, you need a patch repository as it has not been approved yet by the fw4spl board. But no major change should now occur. This repository is only available on https://bitbucket.org/fw4splorg/fw4spl-patches[Bitbucket]. You can clone both the source repository and the patch repository with a single command :

`hg qclone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/fw4splorg/fw4spl-patches`

Then, be sure to switch to the branch *fw4spl_0.10.2* in both repositories. Do the same for *fw4spl-ext* if you use it.

If you're stuck somewhere, you can request some support at *fw4spl at gmail.com*.
