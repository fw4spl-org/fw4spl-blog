= Native debugging on Android, with QtCreator

=== 0. Debugging is a key feature !

Having an efficient debugging environment is a key factor not only for robustness, but also for *efficient* development. +
And as a matter of fact, QtCreator allows you to debug an Android app *kinda* "out of the box" - at least if you use their build and deploy pipeline. +  
Unfortunately, for our more general case, where we have our *custom pipeline*, it just doesn't work !

So lately, we have invested time in integrating a decent debugging solution to our new Android workflow. 
And we think you should do the same. + 
Really.

But looking at the internet, it seems that even after a few years, many people are still struggling with native debugging on Android. And obviously, there are many pitfalls. +
Since we're a pretty nice bunch of guys (yes we are!), we thought we could share our work and help a little.

NOTE: We are assuming that you can build an native app already _(if not, you can read our previous article on link:https://fw4spl-org.github.io/fw4spl-blog/2015/04/13/Fw4spl-and-Android.html[FW4SPL and Android])_.


This article is a bit long, but it's mostly setup & explanations.

*=> In the end you will be able to debug using QtCreator (with breakpoints and all) just by pressing F6 then Enter !*

:: And this without having to root your Android device !


=== 1. Short explanation : gdb & gdbserver

A debugging session on Android will require *gdb* and *gdbserver* to communicate, and specificaly those provided in the *android-ndk*. +
As for now, this is the official and only way of debugging that Google provides.
 

In a nutshell...

*Gdb (on your computer)* needs to connect to *gdbserver (on the android device)*, so that it can send the debug commands of the user, and retrieve debug informations in return.

Obviously, before that gdbserver has to be *launched* on the device, and *attached* to the Android process to debug.

Also, in order to exchange valid debug data, gdb must be taught a few things that it cannot "just guess", e.g. where to find local copies of the executable to debug, the linked libraries, the other system libraries - cf. "retrieving the sysroot". 

=== 2. Setup 

Ok, now before being able to debug, you will need to prepare your environment, which means :

. retrieve a local copy of the sysroot of your device
. put gdbserver in your apk and have a script to start it
. setup QtCreator


===== 2.1. Sysroot


For ease of use, we provide the script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/android-cmake/master/pull_sysroot.py.
It does the whole sysroot pulling in one command, and goes something like :

[source,bash]
pull_sysroot.py Nexus C:/Tmp

:: _Of course you specify the name you want, and the path you want... just remember that you will you them later (cf. 2.3 and 3.)_


That's it !

Not only will it *"adb pull"* the most important files /system/bin/*app_process* and /system/bin/*linker*, but also the libraries in */system/lib/* and */vendro/lib/*.

For your information  :

[horizontal]
* *app_process* : _entry point for the debugger, since it is responsible for starting any Activity on Android_
* *linker* : _required to set breakpoints_


IMPORTANT: From one device to another, *app_process* can either be a binary file or a symlink to the actual binary file. And because pulling a symlink just doesn't work, the script will try to pull the various files it may point to, i.e.  *app_process32*, *app_process64*, or *app_process_init* (... or  something else ?) + 
=> So be sure to use the right version that you pulled - it's printed at the end of the execution of the sript.



===== 2.2. gdbserver

First, make sure you have *packaged a copy of "gdbserver"* with the app you want to debug +
=> and call this copy *"libgdbserver.so"*

TIP: And I strongly advise you to set this up in your build pipeline once for all, for every Android debug build. That's what we have done, and that's pretty neat.

NOTE:  The right copy of *"gdbserver"* to use can be found in your *"android-ndk\prebuilt\android-arm\gdbserver\"* directory.


Then get a copy of the script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/android-cmake/master/start_gdbserver.py, and modify its vars *ANDROID_APK_PACKAGE* and *ACTIVITY_NAME* to match your app. 

TIP: This script will be in charge of launching the app to debug on the device, and attaching the *gdbserver* packaged with it to this app, leaving it waiting for a connection from gdb (on the port 5039).



===== 2.3. QtCreator

To make things easier for everyone, I provide here a complete set of screenshots. +
=> use them to setup your QtCreator.

. First, make sure QtCreator knows the paths to your android sdk & ndk (cf. Tools > Android).

. Then, following the policy of QtCreator, we will need to create a Kit per type of Android device we will want to use for debugging, since *1 Kit = 1 sysroot*.


WARNING: Be careful, here is a first trick : in the fields *Device Type* and *Device*, you MUST specify "Desktop" and "Local PC" !

.Build & Run - Kits
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/fw4spl-blog/gh-pages/images/Tuto_GdbServer/0.QtCreatorOptions/0.KitAndroidDevice.png[ Kit Android Device ]

[start = 3]
. In the Additional Startup Commands of the GDB panel, we tell gdb :
** to execute the non blocking script *"C:/Dev/Scripts/start_gdbserver.py"* +
(gdb command *"source"*)
** where on our local host to search for the .so libraries of our app +
(gdb command set *"solib-search-path"*)

.GDB

[start = 4]
. The GDB Extended panel contains one critical option : + 
:: *"use asynchronous mode to control the inferior"*

WARNING: Did I say it was a critical option ?

That's it !


=== 3. Using it : Debug, now !


. Assuming you have already deployed your app (containing libgdbserver.so) on your device, now you just have to open the panel *"Attach to Running Debug Server..."* 

TIP: You should really consider binding the F6 key to this action!


.Start Debug

[start = 2]
. And properly fill it, with :
* the right Kit
* the *server port 5039* (which is forwarded to a unix pipe by the *start_gdbserver.py* script)
* the right *app_process* (see 2.1. - tag 'important').


NOTE: Good news : QtCreator will remember these infos.

[start = 3]
. Now press "OK", and wait !

=> Put breakpoints anywhere in your code, and enjoy !

NOTE: Here is what happens behind the hoods when you press "OK" : +
 1. QtCreator launches gdb... +
 2. which will execute the script "start_gdbserver.py" (as required by commands we added in "Additional Startup  Commands")... +
 3. then connect to gdbserver (using the command *"target remote :5039"*) ... +
 4. load the libraries... +
 5. and continue the execution of the app !


=== 4. Known limitations

. On applications linked with many libraries, gdb startup can be really slow... but there is nothing we can do, except from stripping the libs we don't want to debug.
. On Windows, the field "Server start script" cannot be used in recent versions of QtCreator (3.4. to 3.5), that's why we use the gdb command *"source"*.
. If you want to debug another app, you will have to modify the vars *"start_gdbserver.py"*... 
. ... and modify the *"solib-search-path"* in the GDB panel.
