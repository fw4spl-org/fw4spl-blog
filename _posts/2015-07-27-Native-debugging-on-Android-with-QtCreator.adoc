=== 0. Debugging is a key feature !

Having an efficient debugging environment is a key factor not only for robustness, but also for **efficient** development.
And as a matter of fact, QtCreator allows you to debug an Android app "**kinda** out of the box". And the problem lies in the "kinda"... For our more general case, where we have our custom build and deploy pipeline, it just doesn't work !

So lately, we have invested time in integrating a decent debugging solution to our new Android workflow. 
And we think you should do the same. Really.

But looking at the internet, it seems that even after a few years, many people are still struggling with native debugging on Android. And obviously, there are many pitfalls.

Since we're a pretty nice bunch of guys (yes we are!), we thought we could share our work and help a little.

Here, we are assuming that you can build an native app already _(if not, you can read our previous article on FW4SPL and Android)_.

This article is a bit long, but it's mostly setup & explanations.

**=> In the end you will be able to debug efficiently using QtCreator**, i.e. :

- run an Android app on your device with **gdbserver attached to it and gdb connecting** 
- put and remove **breakpoints** while it's running 
- see the **values** of your vars

And this without having to root your Android device !


=== 1. Short explanation : gdb & gdbserver

A debugging session on Android will require **gdb** and **gdbserver** to communicate, and specificaly those provided in the **android-ndk**.
As for now, this is the official and only way of debugging that Google provides.

In a nutshell...

**Gdb (local)** needs to connect to **gdbserver (on the android device)**, so that it can send the debug commands of the user, and retrieve debug informations in return.

Obviously, before that gdbserver has to be **launched** on the device, and **attached** to the Android process to debug.

Also, in order to exchange valid debug data, gdb must be taught a few things that it cannot "just guess", like where to find (locally) :

- a copy of the executable
- a copy of the linked libraries
- a copy of the other system libraries - cf. "retrieving the sysroot"


 



=== 2. Setup

So before being able to debug, you will need to prepare your environment, which means :


- retrieve a local copy of the sysroot of your device
- put gdbserver in your apk and have a script to start it
- setup QtCreator


===== 2.1. Sysroot


For ease of use, we provide the script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/android-cmake/master/pull_sysroot.py.
It does the whole sysroot pulling in one command :

[source,bash]
pull_sysroot.py <DEVICE_NAME> <LOCAL_SYSROOT_BASE_PATH>


That's it !

Still, you should know that the most important files are the following :

 - /system/bin/app_process _(entry point for the debugger, since it is responsible for starting any Activity on Android.)_
 - /system/bin/linker _(required to set breakpoints)_
 - /system/lib/libc.so _(one of the base library for any native app)_


It might be useful though to retrieve the whole content of _/system/lib_ and _/vendor/lib_, and that's what the script does, using the command '**adb pull**'.



===== 2.2. gdbserver

* First, make sure you have packaged a copy of _gdbserver_ with the app you want to debug - and call this copy _"libgdbserver.so"_ 

The right copy of _gdbserver_ to use can be found in your _android-ndk\prebuilt\android-arm\gdbserver\_.
And I strongly advise you to set this up in your build pipeline once for all, for every Android debug build. That's what we have done, and that's pretty neat.

* Then get a copy of the script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/android-cmake/master/start_gdbserver.py, and modify its vars **ANDROID_APK_PACKAGE** and **ACTIVITY_NAME** to match your app. 

This script will be in charge of launching the app to debug on the device, and attaching the _gdbserver_ packaged with it to this app, leaving it waiting for a connection from gdb (on the port 5039).



=> So yes, if you want to debug another app, modify the script again!


===== 2.3. QtCreator


* First, make sure QtCreator knows the paths to your android sdk & ndk (cf. Tools > Android).


* Then, following the policy of QtCreator, we will need to create a Kit per type of Android device we will want to use for debugging, since **1 Kit = 1 sysroot**.


Be careful, here is a first trick : in the fields **Device Type** and **Device**, you MUST specify "Desktop" and "Local PC" !

* In the Additional Startup Commands of the GDB panel, we tell gdb :
** to execute the non blocking script "C:/Dev/Scripts/start_gdbserver.py"
** where on our local host to search for the .so libraries of our app

.GDB

* The GDB Extended panel contains one critical option : **"use asynchronous mode to control the inferior"**

That's it !


=== 3. Using it !


===== 3.1. Open & Setup your project



The followings tools are required:


.ImportProject
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/fw4spl-blog/gh-pages/images/Tuto_GdbServer/1.SetupProject/0.ImportProject.png[]

.Open CMakeLists
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/fw4spl-blog/gh-pages/images/Tuto_GdbServer/1.SetupProject/1.OpenCMakeLists.png[]

.Choose Build Location
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/fw4spl-blog/gh-pages/images/Tuto_GdbServer/1.SetupProject/2.ChooseBuildLocation.png[]

.Run CMake - or just click Finish
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/fw4spl-blog/gh-pages/images/Tuto_GdbServer/1.SetupProject/3.RunCMake.png[]

.Change the Kit

.Build step

.Run and Deploy steps

===== 3.2. Debug !


Now you just have to open the panel "Attach to Running Debug Server..." (and you should really consider binding the F6 key to this action)...


.Start Debug
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/fw4spl-blog/gh-pages/images/Tuto_GdbServer/2.Launch/0.Launch.png[]


And properly fill it, with the server port 5039 used in the start_gdbserver.py script, and the right app_process.


.ImportProject
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw4spl-org/fw4spl-blog/gh-pages/images/Tuto_GdbServer/2.Launch/1.AttachToRunningDebugServer.png[]

On pressing "OK", it will launch gdb, which will execute the script "start_gdbserver.py" (as required by commands we added in "Additional Startup Commands"). That will actually launch the app we want to debug on the device, and attach gdbserver to it.
